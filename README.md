# Diary

Flexbox is very difficult. There are many, many properties, and it requires
more practice to familiarize myself with them. Even months later, coming back
to clean the code and rewrite the README file, I still struggle. And I finished
the Foundations path already. Maybe it says more about me than about the 
difficulty of Flexbox.  

What is a hero?  Is a banner (with images, videos, or text) at the very top of
a webpage. Some heroes disappear after a few seconds.  

I remember to commit more systematically. This will avoid huge issues like the
ones I had with the first project. Commit early and often. List castling.
