Using Flexbox to recreate a layout from a picture

Flexbox has proven powerful but difficult for me. 
There are many, many adjustable properties. 
Each property has a different yet similar name to
another one. It is difficult to keep track of everything.
One lesson I am trying to learn is this: a div that contains
only text can be a flexbox, and its text will then become
a flex item, meaning the text will submit to laws governing
all flex items. I forgot/didn't know this. Text acts like
a box if its div has display: flex; enabled.
