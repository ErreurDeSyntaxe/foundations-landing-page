Using Flexbox to recreate a layout from a picture

Flexbox has proven powerful but difficult for me. 
There are many, many adjustable properties. 
Each property has a different yet similar name to
another one. It is difficult to keep track of everything.
One lesson I am trying to learn is this: a div that contains
only text can be a flexbox, and its text will then become
a flex item, meaning the text will submit to laws governing
all flex items. I forgot/didn't know this. Text acts like
a box if its div has display: flex; enabled.

What is a Hero? Is it the topmost element of a page?
Does it go underneath the header or above it? 
OK! It's the text that appears below the header. The 
header contains links like "home" or "login", but the hero
is a banner, much like an ad.
