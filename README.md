Using Flexbox to recreate a layout from a picture

Flexbox has proven powerful but difficult for me. 
There are many, many adjustable properties. 
Each property has a different yet similar name to
another one. It is difficult to keep track of everything.
One lesson I am trying to learn is this: a div that contains
only text can be a flexbox, and its text will then become
a flex item, meaning the text will submit to laws governing
all flex items. I forgot/didn't know this. Text acts like
a box if its div has display: flex; enabled.

First Entry: Roadblock
What is a Hero? Is it the topmost element of a page?
Does it go underneath the header or above it? 
OK! It's the text that appears below the header. The 
header contains links like "home" or "login", but the hero
is a banner, much like an ad.

Second Entry: Commit
I am making an effort to commit any major change so there is
no major conflict to resolve after hours and hours of hard work.
The page content has been written in. Now the fun begins. Let's CSS.

Third Entry: Alignment
Why is alignment so difficult? I'm finished with the header section
of the project, but the links in the top right corner are not 
well aligned with the header logo on the other side of the page.
I tried to lower the links vertically, but I didn't succeed. Tough.

Fourth Entry: Progress
Progress has been steady. It easier to recall the property names and
values. It is also easier to remember to commit. So far, I committed
each section individually. Header. Hero. Info. Quotation. It does
take a long time to finish one single web page, though. No doubt, I
will increase my speed as I gain experience. It is both encouraging
and discouraging. But the bridge behind me has burnt down. Onwards.
